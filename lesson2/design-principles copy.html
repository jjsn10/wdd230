        <div class="contrast">
            <h3>Contrast</h3>
            <div class="box">
                <ul>
                    <li>Subzero</li>
                    <li><a href="https://subzeroicecream.com/">subzeroicecream.com</a></li>
                </ul>
                <img src="images/Subzero.PNG" alt="">
                <p>The subzero icecream website use the contrast in colors and shapes to capture the attention of the audience of certain parts of the website. Example, the color of the button "Find a location" and Request Catering information" show a contrasts of colors. Also, the shape of the banner in header section contrast with the content of the main content of the website.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="repetition">
            <h3>Repetition</h3>
            <div class="box">
                <ul>
                    <li>Mcdonalds</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/full-menu.html">www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/full-menu.html</a></li>
                </ul>
                <img src="images/mcdonalds.PNG" alt="">
                <p>Mcdonald's uses repetition using the same element many times to show the list of dishes that they have. Also, They show a list of food in a simple and clear way, eliminating any source of distraction. For example, They only show in all their products a descriptive picture and a short name of the dish. Even though the shapes and colors are repetitive, users can find any products easily.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="balance">
            <h3>Balance</h3>
            <div class="box">
                <ul>
                    <li>Millhaven</li>
                    <li><a href="https://theblacksheeprestaurant.com/">millhavenhome.com</a></li>
                </ul>
                <img src="images/theblacksheep.PNG" alt="">
                <p>The black sheep website has distributed its contents and color with balance. Even though they need to show a lot of information to the users, they have distributed the content symmetrically. In other words, they don't overload any part of the website with a lot of shapes and colors to show something important. Therefore, the users are not focused on one part only of the website but on all parts of it.</p>
