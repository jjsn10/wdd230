        <div class="demo-discovery">
        <p>Saratoga Springs is expected to have over <b>120,000</b> residents at build out. With so much continued growth, 
            the City is taking advantage of the great opportunity to work with residents, land owners and developers 
            to proactively plan for the future needs of our residents.</p>
        <p>Saratoga Springs is experiencing exponential growth, while our neighbors within the trade area are likewise experiencing a similar growth rate.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Utah Governor's Office of Economic Development identified Saratoga Springs with the fastest growth rate in the State from <b>2000-2010</b> at <b>1,672.8%</b>. This trend is only continuing.</li>
            <li>Saratoga Springs was recently identified as the epicenter for growth in Utah, with an average growth rate of 635 residential units, or <b>2,700 </b>new residents, each year.</li>
            <li>The City's current population is nearly <b>38,000</b> residents and growing far ahead of prior projections. </li>
            <li>This continued growth will translate into a <b>35 percent population</b> increase over the next <b>5 years</b> or <b>51,000 total residents</b>. At this rate, Saratoga Springsâ€™ population will nearly double in the next <b>10 years</b>.</li>

                <h2>Hot Springs in Saratoga</h2>
                <p>Saratoga Hot Spring is a great natural soaking pool located in the lakeside wetlands 
                    at the northwest shore of Utah Lake. It is alternatively known as Inlet Hot Spring 
                    in many resources. To visit the spring, park at Inlet Park and take the cement path 
                    southward. After 150 yards enter a grove of trees and soon the soaking pool is on your 
                    left surrounded by mud, reeds, and fantastic views of the Wasatch Mountains as a backdrop.</p>

            <h2>Saratoga Spring Marina</h2>
            <p>Boat launch, docks and marina keeps our residents thoroughly entertained! Launch into Utah's biggest 
                lake from our private boat launch and find there is plenty of room to fish, boat, jet-ski, windsurf, 
                kayak, canoe, and sail surrounded by Utah's most beautiful sceneries.</p>
            <p>As a proactive city, Saratoga Springs decided to dredge 3-4 feet off the bottom 
                of their marina to allow for improved access in the future even those low water 
                years like 2016. Efforts have been made to improve the quality of the marine and 
                optimize its recreational value. The total dredging cost of the marina is $488,600.</p>

            <h2>Saratoga Spring Jordan River</h2>
            <p>The Jordan River is Utah Lake's only outflow. It originates at the northern end of the lake between the cities 
                of Lehi and Saratoga Springs. It then meanders north through the north end of Utah Valley for approximately 8 miles 
                (13 km) until it passes through a gorge in the Traverse Mountains, known as the Jordan Narrows. The Utah National 
                Guard base at Camp Williams lies on the western side of the river through much of the Jordan Narrows. The Turner Dam, 
                located 41.8 miles (67.3 km) from the river's mouth (or at river mile 41.8) and within the boundaries of the Jordan 
                Narrows, is the first of two dams of the Jordan River. Turner Dam diverts the water to the right or easterly into 
                the East Jordan Canal and to the left or westerly toward the Utah and Salt Lake Canal.</p>

            <h2>Saratoga Spring Library</h2>
            <p>Saratoga Springs is one of the few American cities in the 21st century to have 
                started a municipal library with a majority of donations from volunteers. 
                In 2010, the city council authorized $10,000 in seed money to fund the start 
                of a city library. In 2013, the library had grown so popular that the city council 
                recognized the need for a full-time library and authorized it. As of August 2022, 
                the library has over 8,000 cardholders and a collection of more than 24,000 items. 
                The library also provides additional programs for residents including science nights, 
                story times, Wiggle Worms, a literacy center, and test proctoring. On January 1, 2014, 
                the city library began operating under new full-time hours. </p>
